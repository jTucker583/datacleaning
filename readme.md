### Use of the Cleaning Script
Much of this readme will be put into the python script as comments.

The use of this script requires the use of 8 additional arguments to specify the files to read, variables and datatypes to track. Much of which is described in the script itself. Data from the gazebo file must be in the format shown in the gazebo file in this github. Data from the results file should be in the format that it is currently in, but I can change the functionality to adapt to a different CSV file.
